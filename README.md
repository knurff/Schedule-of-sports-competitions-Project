# Simple sport sheduler web app


## About
In this project I have implemented the task of my coursework on programming. Its essence was to create a service for which
default user can:
* see the schedule; 
* search game by the team name;
 
the administrator can:

* create, edit and delete teams; 
* create, edit and delete competitions; 
* enter the results for competitions;
* all from default user.

## Used technologies
This project has used:
* Spring Boot; 
* Spring MVC to implement MVC pattern;
*  Spring JPA and Hibernate to store data in PostgreSQL database; 
*  Hibernate for default and custom Bean Validation; 
* Spring Security to authorize admins and maybe implement a large and flexible role system in the future ;
* Thymeleaf and Bootstrap for view.
